Other times, I found myself rushing through reading large portions in order to finish the reading on time for the meeting. So I mixed my passion for development and my theocratic needs to create a web service sending an email every morning with the daily portion. {{{<br>}}}{{{<br>}}}From this simple service, I decided to put it online so everyone could enjoy what I found useful.

Those special links are called \"anchors\". However, current email clients disallow anchor links for security reasons. Anchors are useful to go down to the research and back to the verse with simple clicks, instead of scrolling manually. To take advantage of this, you need to read the portion online."
